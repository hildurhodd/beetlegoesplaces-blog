      <description>The reason for us not traveling lately is that I have been sick. The beetle has truly been a Super beetle, getting me to and from the hospital for many days.
I have to tell you about a parking garage in Sanitas Hospital Cima. Each time we parked there we saw expensive supercars, which does not surprise me because it has the cleanest floors I have ever seen, and they are white!</description>

      <description>We went on a day trip on the Beetle to a small town named Tossa de Mar, Catalonia, Spain, located on the Costa Brava. It is a charming town with a beautiful fortified medieval area from the 14th century. The city centre is a little crowded and full of tourist shops selling all kind of tourist merchandise but the Vila Vella and the beaches are really worth the visit. The narrow cobblestone streets, stone walls and the vegetation is very charming and peaceful.</description>

      <description>I have wanted to own a Volkswagen Beetle since I was a teenager. On the 29th of June 2017 that dream came true when my boyfriend gave me one as a birthday present.
We spent a lot of time surfing the internet and traveling around Spain in a rental car to find the right Beetle. We stumbled upon this white beautiful 1971 model of 1302 Super Beetle in Tarragona, Spain. The owner had restored this car beautifully, he had held on to the original character of the car and the engine sounded perfectly.</description>
